Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Ohio State Univerisity, advised by [Prof. Zhang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/zhang.7824/).

I am passionate about advancing data-centric AI through principled methods for data attribution. Currently I am designing tools that quantify the value of dataset both fairly and efficiently. My research focuses on developing theoretically grounded yet scalable approaches that can be applied across diverse AI applications including generative AI modeling [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19013).

As a statistician, I am also deeply interested in methods that quantify uncertainty in black-box models, especially those that remain robust under model misspecification. My broader goal is to create algorithms that are not only statistically sound but also computationally feasible, so they can scale with modern AI systems [[2]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bt1vnCnAVS&noteId=uNqjmfay9Q).

## Research Interests

My research interests span across several areas in statistics and machine learning:

- **Data-Centric AI**
- **Uncertainty Quantification**

## Publications

- **Faithful Group Shapley Value**  
  Developed a fast and robust method for group-data valuation that satisfies a novel faithfulness axiom, ensuring resistance to adversarial manipulation and strong theoretical guarantees. **ICML 2025 DataWorld Workshop, Best Paper Award** *(Honorable Mention; 3 out of 55 submissions)*.  
  [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19013)

- **Leave-One-Out Stable Conformal Prediction**  
  Proposed a novel conformal prediction algorithm leveraging algorithmic stability, achieving fast and reliable uncertainty quantification without sacrificing statistical validity.  
  **ICLR 2025**
