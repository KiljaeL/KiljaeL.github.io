Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Ohio State Univerisity, advised by [Prof. Zhang](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/zhang.7824/).

I am passionate about advancing data-centric AI through principled methods for data attribution. Currently I am designing tools that quantify the value of dataset both fairly and efficiently. My research focuses on developing theoretically grounded yet scalable approaches that can be applied across diverse AI applications including generative AI modeling [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19013).

As a statistician, I am also deeply interested in methods that quantify uncertainty in black-box models, especially those that remain robust under model misspecification. My broader goal is to create algorithms that are not only statistically sound but also computationally feasible, so they can scale with modern AI systems [[2]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bt1vnCnAVS&noteId=uNqjmfay9Q).
